Hi. Hey. Welcome to the latest home of my knitting. In recent history, I blogged at [Michael Knits](http://michaelknits.blogspot.com), and in more ancient history, at [This Boy Knits](http://thisboyknits.blogspot.com). But now I think it's time to bring my work in, and start publishing in my own house, as it were.

You can find my semi-regular images and other stuff on my [instagram feed](http://instagram.com/mywynne), so here I'm planning to talk more about process. Design process, knitting process, all that good stuff. I'll probably be reposting some of my older posts from elsewhere, but you can expect some neat new content here in the coming weeks - I've got a truly unique project on the go that I think you'll enjoy.

The above pattern, Chimera, can be purchased through [Urban Yarns](http://www.urbanyarns.com/search.php?search_query=chimera), though I will probably have it up on Ravelry, at some point...

I'll also be updating the site itself a bit over the coming weeks, I have a few more features planned, so check back sometime!
And of course, I want to hear from you! Is there something you'd like me to write about, or just want more information, let me know - contact information is on the right, or just reply to a post!

And with that, I'll be back with you all soon enough. In the meantime, I think the inimitable LL Cool J said it best...
